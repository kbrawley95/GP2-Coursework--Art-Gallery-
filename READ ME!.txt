PROJECT SETUP
Right click My Computer/This PC then click properties.
On the left hand side click advance system settings.
Now in advanced tab click environment variables.
Create a new varible called "CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH".
Set its value to where your libraries are located.

NOTE: your folders must be layed out like so

		 |--bin
Libraries|--include
		 |--lib

Put all of the include folders/files, lib files and dll files in the apropriate folder.

Finally restart Cmake and delete your cache.
Now your cmake should find all dependencies on its own.
